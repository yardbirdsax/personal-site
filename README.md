# My Personal Site

This is the repository where the code that powers [my personal site](https://josh.feiermanfamily.com) is kept. It is based on the Developer Diaries Gatsby theme by [Will Ward](https://github.com/willjw3).

The site is built with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and hosted on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
