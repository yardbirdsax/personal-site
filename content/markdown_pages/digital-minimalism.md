This is my page where I collect and organize resources for pursuing the practice of digital minimalism.

## Books

- [*Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World*](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy-ebook/dp/B07DBRBP7G), by Cal Newport.

## My Pages

- [Tech Usage Policy](/techusage) - My rules for how I use technology in my life.
- [High Value Activities](/high-value-activities) - A running list of examples of high value activities that I'd like to engage in rather than shallow digital ones (such as consuming content and web surfing).
- [The Practice of Deliberate Reading](/deliberate-reading) - How I curate and read articles to stay informed without falling into the endless pool of possibilities.
