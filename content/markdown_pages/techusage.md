## Purpose

This page documents the rules I'm agreeing to follow in my usage of technology, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, etc. I'm trying to be more intentional around my use of technology, because I see daily the results when I do not do this. Especially in times of turmoil like this, it's easy to let digital distraction rule our lives. I refuse to let this happen any longer.

I would like to pubicly thank [Josh Duffney](http://duffney.io/Digital-Declutter-Discover-SelfRelection-and-DeepThought) for inspiring me to take this on.

### When Things Go Bad

Here are examples of the results when I let technology have its way with me:

* My anxiety level increases, because:
  * I tend to read more anxiety inducing content, such as constant updates about the state of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  * I have too many inputs coming in, which overwhelms me.
  * Once I realise how much time I've spent mindlessly using tech, I feel anxious because I haven't gotten things done that I know are important.
* I feel guilty because:
  * I'm neglecting my family, or at least not being present with them.
  * I'm not getting things done that I said I would.
* I'm less productive because:
  * Consuming content results in a feeling of accomplishment, when in reality you're not producting anything of value.
  * The time spent consuming technology uses up an already scarce resource, namely my time.

### What I Want to Accomplish

Here are the goals I want to accomplish as part of implementing these rules. These should be [SMART](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/learnstorm-growth-mindset-activities-us/elementary-and-middle-school-activities/setting-goals/v/learnstorm-growth-mindset-how-to-write-a-smart-goal) to the greatest extent possible.

* By April 13th, reduce overall smartphone and tablet usage to less than one hour per day. This will be tracked using ScreenTime in iOS. Exceptions to time tracked include: 
  * Waze (navigation)
  * Music
* By April 13th, accomplish the following household non-technology related items:
  * Prepare and plant the garden
  * Split and stack the wood that's been sitting for almost 2 years
* Spend at least 15 quality minutes per day with each child on 90% of days between now and April 13th
* Spend at least 30 quality minutes per day with my wife on 90% of days between now and April 13th

## Technologies In Scope

The following are the technologies in scope and the specific procedures used to curb their usage.

| Technology                | Strategies                                      | Implemented? |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Twitter                   | Do not access from my phone or tablets. Access only from computer at scheduled times. I will choose the times to access during my daily planning session.           | Partial, need to determine a way to block access through Firefox on my phone (app is on there to allow for backup of my settings).  |
LinkedIn                    | Do not access from my phone or tablets. Access only from computer at scheduled times. I will choose the times to access during my daily planning session.           | Partial, need to determine a way to block access through Firefox on my phone (app is on there to allow for backup of my settings).  |
Slack                       | Remove from my phone, access only from my computer. For non-work Slack channels, I will choose the times to access during my daily planning session. For work Slack channels, I use Do Not Disturb during deep work sessions to minimize distractions. | Done, app has been removed. |
Discord                     | Remove from my phone, access only from my computer. I will choose the times to access during my daily planning session. | Done, app has been removed. |
Snapchat                    | Turn off all notifications. Check once per day during a scheduled break.  | Done, notifications are off. Will monitor to see if leaving my phone in my bedroom is adequate to curb this.  |
General cellphone usage     | Leave my phone plugged in on my bedside table so I don't have it with me. To help mitigate the fear of missing a call, I will 1) turn up the ringer volume, 2) ensure wifi / cellular is enabled on my Apple watch, so that I can receive calls on it.  | Phone is plugged in and left, currently working on enabling cellular on my watch. |
General iPad / tablet usage | Leave my iPad in a drawer in my bediside table. Turn on only when something is specifically required for it.  | Done, it's turned off and in the drawer. |
